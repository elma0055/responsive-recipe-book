Milk Chocolate Digestive Cookies
Tempering chocolate can be challenging for bakers, but if you follow this recipe, it’ll be a snap.
Ingredients
1 cup whole wheat flour
⅓ cup all-purpose flour
⅓ cup wheat bran
¼ cup packed light brown sugar
½ tsp salt
⅔ cup cold unsalted butter, cubed
1 - 2 tbsp milk
3 cups chopped milk chocolate
Preparation
Preheat oven to 350 F. Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside.
In a food processor, pulse together flours, wheat bran, sugar and salt. Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add milk until dough is moistened and holds together when squeezed.
Turn dough out onto counter and knead gently to bring together.
How to make a perfect chocolate cookie:
Flour counter and roll dough to scant ¼-inch thick. Cut into rounds and place on prepared baking sheets.
Bake 16 - 18 minutes, until firm and edges begin to brown. Cool for two minutes on pan, then remove to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.
While cookies are baking, melt ¾ of the chocolate in a large heat-proof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Melt chocolate to 45 C. Remove from heat and add reserved chocolate. Continue stirring until temperature reaches 27 C. Briefly place bowl over simmering water and heat chocolate gently to 29 - 30 C.
Dip one face of each cookie into tempered chocolate, then make a criss-cross pattern in the chocolate with the tines of a fork. Place — chocolate side up — on cooling racks to dry.
