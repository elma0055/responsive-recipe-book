Philâ€™s Chickpea Chocolate Mint Chip Cookies
A delicious gluten, nut, and dairy free, plant-based cookie that still tastes just as good as the other, glutenous cookies out there. Chickpeas add a protein packed punch to every bite while chocolate and mint keep everything festive!
Ingredients
1 cup pitted Medjool dates
1 (540 mL/19 oz) can chickpeas, drained
1/2 cup coconut syrup
3/4 cup cocoa powder
1/4 cup sunflower seed butter
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp mint extract
1 tsp vanilla
1 cup non-dairy dark chocolate chips
Icing sugar to dust
Preparation
Soak the dates in boiling water for 20 minutes or until soft. Drain the liquid from the dates and add dates to a food processor.
Preheat oven to 350F. Line a baking tray with parchment paper and set aside.
Add the remaining ingredients to the food processor and blend until mixture is smooth and creamy. Transfer cookie dough to a bowl. Stir in chocolate chips.
Scoop heaping tablespoons of dough 2 to 3 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheet. Flatten with the back of a spoon.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until tops start to crack. Let cookies cool on baking sheet for five minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.  Using a sieve, dust tops of cookies lightly with icing sugar.
Servings: Makes 12 cookies
